## Iris Flower Segmentation:
There is famous dataset that includes sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width of 150 iris flower that categorized in three different class:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica   
     
I implemented K-Means algorithm from scrach using python and used the algorithm to group the records to three clusters. You can access the `.ipynb` file by downloading `Iris Flower Segmentation.ipynb`
  
## Movie Recommender System:
Generally there are 2 methods of recommender system:
  - Content Based
  - User Based (collaborative)   
     
I decided to create a collaborative movie recommender system and downloaded [MovieLenz](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) dataset and implement an algorithm to suggest 5 movies to a user. 
For doing this Project I must answer to these questions:
  - How much are the users near to our target user?
  - How much would target user rate if he watched each movie?
